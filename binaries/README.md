# Binaries for parseresults

This directory contains statically linked binaries for platforms I cared enough about to build them. These files are provided as a convenience to you so they may very well not work at all.

Rename the relevant file for your platform to 'parseresults' and move it to the root folder of the loadtest project. If your system runs it, yay! If not, check out the Makefile in the cpp directory in order to build your own.
